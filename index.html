                    I created a web application that used a dataset of
                    crime statistics from the New York City Police
                    Department to create an interactive and informative
                    map of the five NYC boroughs that could
                    theoretically help tourists avoid dangerous areas
                    of the city during specific times of the day and
                    during times of the year where crime was more
                    prominent. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React
                    to create a dynamic front-end, and I used Node.js,
                    Express.js, and Oracle Database for a robust and
                    scalable back-end.
